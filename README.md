What is the relation between the brother of my third brother’s son’s paternal grandfather and the sister of my second sister’s daughter’s maternal grandmother’s husband’s brother?

Answer: Siblings or brother and sister.

*Solution:*

**Step One:**
Let's split the problem into two sentences with an intercept:
A = the brother of my third brother’s son’s paternal grandfather
B = the sister of my second sister’s daughter’s maternal grandmother’s husband’s brother

**Step Two:**
Breaking down the relationships step by step for A, where A is:
A = the brother of my third brother’s son’s paternal grandfather, then:
My third brother’s son: This would be my Nephew.
My Nephew’s paternal grandfather: This would be my Dad.
The brother of my Dad: This would be my Uncle.

**Step Three:**
Breaking down the relationships step by step for B, where B is:
B = the sister of my second sister’s daughter’s maternal grandmother’s husband’s brother, then:
My second sister’s daughter: This would be my niece.
My niece’s maternal grandmother: This would be my Mom.
My Mom’s husband: This would be my Dad.
My Dad’s brother: This would be my Uncle
The sister of my Uncle: This would be my Aunt.

Step Four:
Hence, the relationship between them is that of brother and sister or just siblings
